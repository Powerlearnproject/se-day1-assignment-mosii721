# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering- Systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintainace of high-quality software systems.
Importance
Helps in the technology industry by enabling the creaion of software applications and systems that power various aspects of life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages e.g C
Establishment of S.E as a discipline in 1960s
Rise of agile methodologies in 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirments- Gathering and documenting user needs
Design - Creating designs of software architecture and ui
Implemntation - Building the software through code
Testing - Conducting various test to ensure the software meets Qa standards
Deployment - Releasing the software to users 
Maintainance - Providing updates,support for issues after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - Sequential approach with distinct phases each phase is completed before going to the next e.g manufacturing process
Agile - iterative and incremental approach e.g Building a mobile app where user feedback can shape features and updates.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Develop applications and systems through programming languages.
QA Engineer - Ensure Software Quality by exucuting and designing test plans 
Project Manager - Involved in planning,execution and resource allocation of the project


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - Software tool for writing,debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio code
VCS - Tool for tracking changes to source code e.g git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Technology -New frameworks, languages, and best practices emerge frequently
soln: Follow industry blogs, attend webinars, and engage with developer communities.
Deadlines - Balancing multiple tasks, features, and deadlines can lead to burnout.
soln: Use Agile methodologies like Scrum to break work into manageable sprints.
Understanding Project Requirements - changing requirements can lead to scope creep.
soln: Engage in active communication with stakeholders and ask clarifying questions.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing - Testing individual software modules
Intergration testing - Testing interactions between diffrent components
system testing - Testing the software system
Acceptance testing - Testing software to ensure it meets user requirments
Importance
The various testing types help in Qa by identifying bugs at an early stage in the development process

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering - Crafting input prompts to get the best possible responses from ai models
Importance
Improved user experience - It enables users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt
Improves AI Response Accuracy - A well-structured prompt helps AI understand user intent
Enhances Efficiency and Productivity - Clear prompts minimize back-and-forth interactions


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - Tell me about space.
Imroved prompt - Give me a quick summary of black holes and how they form.

More Specific – Instead of a broad topic like space it focuses on black holes and how they form.
Clear Intent – The phrase quick summary tells the AI to keep the response concise.
Reduces Ambiguity – The AI knows exactly what to explain rather than guessing what aspect of space you’re interested in.
